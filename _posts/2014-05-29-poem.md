今天下午，逛阮一峰博客，再次看到这首诗歌，记在这里。

原诗没有标题，也不知作者。
>
People live people die
People laugh people cry
Some give up some will try
Some say hi some say bye
Some may forget you but never will I

>
Feel good when somebody misses you
Feel better when somebody loves you
But feel best when somebody never forgets you

>
Flowers need sunshine
Violets need dew
All Angels in heaven know I need you
Years may fly
Tears may dry
But my friendship with you will never die

>
If kisses were water
I will give you sea
If kisses were leaves
I will give you a tree
If you love planet
I will give you a galaxy
If friendship were life I will give you mine

>
In my life I learned how to love to smile to be happy to be strong to work hard to be honest to be faithful to forgive
But I couldn't learn how to stop remembering you

>
There are many stars but the moon is you
There are many friends but the best is you
To forget me that's up to you
To forget you I will never ever do

>
You may be out of my sight but not out of my heart
You may be out of my reach but not out of my mind
I may mean nothing to you but you will always be special to me!
